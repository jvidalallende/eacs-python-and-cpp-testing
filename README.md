# Introduction

This repository hosts the investigation assignment for EACS Software Tests.
It is focused on how to use [Python] to test [C++] programs.

You can find the presentation complementing this work here: [C/C++ unit testing with Python]

# Authors

This assignment is done by:
* Juan Ramón Medina Muñoz ([jramed])
* Juan Vidal Allende ([jvidalallende])

# Motivation

Python can be integrated with other languages, one of them is C++, see [Python and C++].
This is a two way road, we can use C/C++ from python, by mean of integrating
built-in modules in python, or run python code from C++.

In this assigment we are focusing in how to integrate  C/C++ code with Python.
Furthermore we are interested if it is possible to run unit tests written in
Python to test C++ code.

The first question we should ask to ourselves is:
[is it acceptable practice to unit test a program in another language]?
As always there are different opinions, but why not? Sometimes it is easier
implement the tests with Python.

The main difficulty is to do the wrapper for the C++ code. For this, there are
different alternatives, with different levels of ease-of-use, C++ support,
compilation time, etc.

As always, it will be a trade-off between needs and personal taste for one approach or another.

# Possible alternatives
To wrap C++ code with a framework (python c++ binding), we have identified the
following alternatives:

* Programming mainly with python:
  * [ctypes] is a foreign function library for Python. It provides C compatible
    data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries.
    It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python.
  * [cffi] C Foreign Function Interface for Python. Interacts with almost any C
    code from Python, based on C-like declarations that you can often copy-paste
    from header files or documentation. (See video from [Alexander Steffen])
* Programming mainly with C++ (see video from [Diego Rodriguez])
  * [boost.python] a C++ library which enables seamless interoperability between
    C++ and the Python programming language
  * [pybind11] similar to boost.python, with less overhead (see video from [Ivan Smirnov])
  * [cython] is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming
    language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex).    
    Can be used to give Pythonic interfaces to C and C++ libraries. See the [cython book].
    Cython is a implementation of the Python language, so the way
    it integrates C/C++ could can not be reused and even there is differencies in
    the API between python 2.7 and 3.5.    
    The documentation from python recomend to use other methods if that integration
    must be portable, that is usable by other python implementation different that Cython.    
    Video, [Cython Tutorial - Bridging between Python and C/C++ for performance].
    
* Using an IDL
  * [SWIG] is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and C++
    with scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl
  * [SIP] is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for C and
    C++ libraries. SIP comprises a code generator and a Python module.
    The code generator processes a set of specification files and generates
    C or C++ code which is then compiled to create the bindings extension module.
    The sip Python module provides support functions to the automatically generated code.

# Code Examples

This repository contains a trimmed, basic implementation of C++ class that can
be used to represent complex numbers. This class is compiled to a static library,
_libcomplex.a_.

The repository also contains some Python test cases. These test cases interface
the libclomplex.a library using some of the technologies mentioned above.

## complex-ctypes

The [ctypes] approach require that a pure C interface is created (see
*Complex_wrapper.cpp*), and after that a Python Complex class (*complex.py*)
is implemented to encapsulate the logic that attacks the C interface. Finally,
test cases can use the Python Complex class.

### Benefits
* Quick compilation
* Up-front code, no autogenerated magic
* Smaller binaries
* No external dependencies

### Drawbacks
* Too much interface code
* Low-level management of types/pointers

## boost.python-example

The [boost.python] approach require having boost python binaries and Python
development headers installed. Then only a tiny wrapper class needs to be
implemented (see *Complex_boost.cpp*).

### Benefits
* Very low amount of extra code needed

### Drawbacks
* Big binary size
* Slow compilation
* Requires binary dependencies and development headers

## pybind11-example

The [pybind11] approach is essentially the same as [boost.python], with a
slightly different syntax.

### Benefits
* Very low amount of extra code needed
* Only depends on development headers (no binary dependencies)

### Drawbacks
* Huge binary size
* Slow compilation

## swig-example

The [swig] way requires a declaration of the classes to be mapped using its
Interface Definition Language (IDL), as it can be seen in _Complex.i_. Then
SWIG will create both the C++ and the Python code required to interface it and
bind it to the Complex C++ class.

### Benefits
* Low amount of extra code needed
* Ability to use different binding languages, not only Python

### Drawbacks
* IDL requires some extra learning
* Support for C++ is limited

# Environment to run the examples

The base environment is based on Ubuntu 16.04, but cygwin is also supported. A
Dockerfile is also provided to create a container image suitable to build the
examples.

## Ubuntu 16.04

The following packages are needed:
* cmake
* g++
* git
* libboost-python-dev
* python-dev
* swig

## Cygwin

The following environment has been partially proven to work:
* gcc with c++ support (tested with 6.4.0)
* cmake 3.0 or higher (tested with 3.6.2)
* make (tested with 4.2.1)
* python 2.7 (tested with 2.7.14)
* python2_devel
* libboost_python-devel
* swig

**python2-devel** package installation was not succesfully performed.

# Run with docker

Just build an image from the provided _Dockerfile_. If you want to run the tests,
attach to the container, go to the _/root/build_ directory, and get into the
example that you want to run. As an example:

```
user@host$ docker build -t python-and-cpp-testing .
user@host$ docker run -it python-and-cpp-testing /bin/bash
root@container# cd /root/build/ctypes-example
root@container# python test_complex.py
```
